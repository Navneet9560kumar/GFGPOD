# 🚀 GeeksforGeeks – Problem of the Day (POTD)

## 📌 About
I consistently solve the **Problem of the Day (POTD)** on **GeeksforGeeks** to strengthen my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of **Data Structures and Algorithms**.

This daily practice helps me:
- Build strong logical thinking
- Improve coding consistency and discipline
- Prepare effectively for **coding interviews**
- Enhance performance in **competitive programming**

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Solve at least one DSA problem daily
- Cover a wide range of topics including Arrays, Strings, Recursion, DP, Trees, Graphs, and more
- Write clean, optimized, and readable code
- Analyze time and space complexity for each solution

---

## 🧠 Learning Approach
- Understand the problem thoroughly before coding
- Try to solve using optimal approaches
- Refactor solutions when better methods are found
- Learn from edge cases and failed submissions

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java  
- **Platform:** GeeksforGeeks  
- **Concepts:** Data Structures, Algorithms, Problem Solving

---

## 📅 Consistency
Solving POTD daily helps maintain a strong problem-solving rhythm and keeps DSA concepts fresh and practical.

---

## 📈 Progress
This repository contains my daily solutions along with:
- Optimized logic
- Clear explanations
- Focus on interview-oriented problems

---

## ⭐ Motivation
> Consistency beats intensity.  
> One problem a day builds strong fundamentals over time.
